# Purpose of this Project
1. Utilize external interfaces (APIs) from multiple databases to retrieve metadata in response to user queries to the LLM, and then use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to output the results of the database queries in natural language.
2. Furthermore, through prompt engineering, it enables optimized output tailored to the each individual, facilitating not only for researchers and experts but also more wide range of people.
3. The goal is to utilize multimodal AI (text, images, audio, etc.) for database retrieval and output visualization, allowing AI that has learned multimodal cognition to act as a hub between users and database. This enables multimedia search and output, creating a knowledge base that can process complex multimedia informations.
